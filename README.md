# About the project, Evaluation CT by #CTDesarrallo #Funiber
### this is a React project using the Nextjs framework

## Technologies used
1. Next.js
2. Tailwind CSS
3. MongoDB Atlas Cloud
4. TypeScript

The project allows us to enter a task, and mark it as completed and we can also delete it, in addition to this in "Fase 2" there is the exercise using javascript logic

### Points to consider
I created the login and register screens, but these do not work, it is a pure front end and they are not connected to the database


## Start the project

Currently this project has to be cloned and initialized using the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
